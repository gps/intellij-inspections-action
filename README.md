# IntelliJ Inspections Action

This is a [Github Action](https://github.com/features/actions) that runs [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)â€™s [Code Inspections](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/code-inspection.html), and comments on a PR with violations.

Please note that this action does not work on projects that already have an IDEA project. That is, your repository must not have the `.idea` folder checked in.

You should have the inspection profile in the root of your repository. It must be in a file named `Project_Default.xml`.
